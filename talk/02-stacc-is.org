* STACC:
    ** Set Theoretic
    ** Algebraic
    ** Constructive
    ** Calculus

* STACC is 
    ** Nobel core language for FP languages
    ** To form the core of my FP language ideas, within a year. Name TBD 
    ** Unorthodox in the sense of not using the foundations of the LC
    ** The foundational metatheory is richer
        *** Nevertheless the semantics can be encoded in LC

* Set theoretic
    ** Related to set theory
    ** Primary building block is the set of predicates 
    ** Set semantics, union is the main combinator

* Algebraic
    ** LC has application and product
    ** STACC has application, product and coproduct

* Constructive
