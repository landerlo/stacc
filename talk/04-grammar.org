* Grammar

## Mayba have side by side panels to show examples alongside grammar, but without distracting about alignment
VAR=$id    --  a
REF=$path  -- a.b.y

POV=   VAR PRED         -- a = {}
PRED=  e PSET              a = b
      |eq COND PSET        b e A
                           |{}, b  = {} 
                           |a   b  = {}

COND= 'always' | PSET


PSET= {}
     |POV* -
     |PSET U PSET   -- {} u {}
     |REF


* Examples
## Show nested sets and the references to subelements in the tree.

## At some point make parallelism with "well formed trees" / or image by V Voedich. Probably this should come earlier?

## Finish with remark that no interesting data can be represented with the deterministic approach. We need inductive types
