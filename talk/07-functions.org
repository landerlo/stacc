* e.g. Addition. Relation of a product of two nats with another nat

Product of two nats 
{ a: Nat, b: Nat }

# Explain the typing here? Probably better before. After the recursive type.

Relation with the addition of those

{ a: Nat
  b: Nat

  result: Nat
  result = | {},                        a = {}, b = {}
           | b,                         a = {}
           | a,                         b = {}
           | self u { a = a, b = b },   
}

# Show a nice syntax? Should the condition object require to 

# /IMG of the relation between numbers sets
