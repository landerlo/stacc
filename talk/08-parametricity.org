* Parametricity


Same as we create dependencies on other properties. If the other property is a Set, we create a dependency of being a member of it

{

T e Set

a e T

}

We've encoded parametricity

e.g. identity

id = { 

    T e Set

    x e T 
    
     => x
}

* As expected we apply the set property same as any other value

idNat = id u { T = Nat }

====
Bonus material:
* Parameterised on the type is just a constraint

There is nothing special about the constraint that it needs to belong to that type.
Equally we could establish other properties.

smallerThan3 = {

x e ( < 3) 

}
